            <i>A product of a boring Sunday:</i><br>
            Once started, LuckySSH generates a random number and that amount of<br>
            random IPs. Those IPs are checked for an active SSH-service, then.<br>
            If an active SSH-service is found, the tool starts a common bruteforce<br>
            attack using most common user:pass combinations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hits are saved to: "hits.txt", stats are shown in window title.<br>
            The amount of IPs being is picked from a range 666 up to 66666.
